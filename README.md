
# Diablo II Save File Format

Diablo II stores your game character on disk as a .d2s file. This
is a binary file format that encodes all of the stats, items, name,
and other pieces of data.

Integers are stored in [little endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness)
byte order, which is the native byte ordering on a x86 architecture Diablo II
is based on.

## Header

Each .d2s file starts with a 765 byte header, after which data
is of variable length.

### Versions

File version. The following values are known:

* `71` is 1.00 through v1.06
* `87` is 1.07 or Expansion Set v1.08
* `89` is standard game v1.08
* `92` is v1.09 (both the standard game and the Expansion Set.)
* `96` is v1.10+

### Checksum

To calculate the checksum set the value of it in the .d2s data
to be zero and iterate through all the bytes in the data calculating
a 32-bit checksum:

<details><summary>code in C</summary>

```C
    sum = (sum << 1) + data[i];
```

If the checksum is invalid, Diablo II will not open the save file.

### Active Weapon

TODO

### Character Name

Character names are store as an array of 16 characters which contain
a null terminated string padded with `0x00` for the remaining bytes.
Characters are stored as 8-bit ASCII, but remember that valid must
follow these rules:
 * Must be 2-15 in length
 * Must begin with a letter
 * May contain up to one hyphen (`-`) or underscore (`_`)
 * May contain letters

### Character Status

This is a 8-bit field:

Bit | Desc
----|------
0   | ?
1   | ?
2   | Hardcore
3   | Died
4   | ?
5   | Expansion
6   | ?
7   | ?

### Character Progression

TODO

### Character Class

ID | Class
---|-------
0  | Amazon
1  | Sorceress
2  | Necromancer
3  | Paladin
4  | Barbarian
5  | Druid
6  | Assassin

### Level

This level value is visible only in character select screen
and must be the same as this in [Stats](#stats) section.

### Hotkeys

TODO

### Character Menu Appearance
32 byte structure which defines how the character looks in the menu
Does not change in-game look


### Difficulty
3 bytes of data that indicates which of the three difficulties the character has unlocked.
Each byte is representitive of one of the difficulties. In this order:
Normal, Nightmare, and Hell.
Each byte is a bitfield structured like this:

 7      | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2, 1, 0
--------|---|---|---|---|-----------
Active? |Unknown|Unknown|Unknown|Unknown|Which act (0-4)?

### Map

TODO

### Quest

TODO

### Waypoint

Waypoint data starts with 2 chars "WS" and
6 unknown bytes, always = {0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x50, 0x00}

Three structures are in place for each difficulty,
at offsets 641, 665 and 689.

The contents of this structure are as follows

byte | bytesize | contents
-----|----------|---------
  0  | 2 bytes  | {0x02, 0x01} Unknown purpose
  2  | 5 bytes  | Waypoint bitfield in order of least significant bit
  7  | 17 bytes | unknown

In the waypoint bitfield, a bit value of 1 means that the waypoint is enabled
It is in an order from lowest to highest, so 0 is Rogue encampment (ACT I) etc.
The first waypoint in each difficulty is always activated.

### NPC

### Stats

### Items

Items are stored in lists described by this header:

Byte | Size | Desc
-----|------|-----
0    | 2    | "JM"
2    | 2    | Item Count

After this come N items. Each item starts with a basic 14-byte
structure. Many fields in this structure are not "byte-aligned"
and are described by their bit position and sizes.

Bit | Size | Desc
----|------|------
0   | 16   | "JM" (separate from the list header)
16  | 4    | ?
20  | 1    | Identified
21  | 6    | ?
27  | 1    | Socketed
28  | 1    | ?
29  | 1    | Picked up since last save
30  | 2    | ?
32  | 1    | Ear
33  | 1    | Starter Gear
34  | 3    | ?
37  | 1    | Compact
38  | 1    | Ethereal
39  | 1    | ?
40  | 1    | Personalized
41  | 1    | ?
42  | 1    | [Runeword](#runeword)
43  | 15   | ?
58  | 3    | [Parent](#parent)
61  | 4    | [Equipped](#equipped)
65  | 4    | Column
69  | 3    | Row
72  | 1    | ?
73  | 3    | [Stash](#parent)
76  | 4    | ?
80  | 24   | Type code (3 letters)
108 |      | [Extended Item Data](#extended-item-data)

### Extended Item Data

If the item is marked as `Compact` (bit 37 is set) no extended
item information will exist and the item is finished.

Items with extended information store bits based on information in the item header. For example, an item marked as `Socketed` will store an
extra 3-bit integer encoding how many sockets the item has.

|Bit | Size | Desc
----|------|-------
|108 |      | [Sockets](#sockets)
|    |      | [Custom Graphics](#custom-graphics)
|    |      | [Class Specific](#class-specific)
|    |      | [Quality](#quality)
|    |      | [Mods](#mods)

### Custom Graphics

Custom graphics are denoted by a single bit, which if
set means a 3-bit number for the graphic index follows. If the
bit is not set the 3-bits are not present.

Bit | Size | Desc
----|------|------
0   | 1    | Item has custom graphics
1   | 3    | Alternate graphic index

### Class Specific

Class items like Barbarian helms or Amazon bows have special
properties specific to those kinds of items. If the first bit
is empty the remaining 11 bits will not be present.

Bit | Size | Desc
----|------|------
0   | 1    | Item has class specific data
1   | 11   | Class specific bits

### Quality

Item quality is encoded as a 4-bit integer.

#### Low Quality


### Mods

After each item is a list of mods. The list is a series of key value
pairs where the key is a 9-bit number and the value depends on the key.
The list ends when key `511` (`0x1ff`) is found which is all 9-bits
being set.

Using the file `ItemStatCost.txt` as a tab-delimited CSV file you can
extract the `ID` column which maps to the 9-bit keys. The columns
`Save Bits` and `Param Bits` describe how large the mod is.

The only exception is min-max style modifiers which use the next row
in the CSV to store the "max" portion of the mod. The bit sizes of
these two can be different and you should sum them to get the total
size.

#### Runeword

TODO

#### Parent

All items are located somewhere and have a "parent" which
can be another item, such as when inserting a jewel.

Value | Desc
------|------
0     | Stored
1     | Equipped
2     | Belt
4     | Cursor
6     | Item

For items that are "stored" a 3-bit integer encoded starting at
bit 73 describes where to store the item:

Value | Desc
------|------
1     | Inventory
4     | Horadric Cube
5     | Stash

### Equipped

Items that are equipped describe their slot:

Value | Slot
------|-----
1     | Helmet
2     | Amulet
3     | Armor
4     | Weapon (Right)
5     | Weapon (Left)
6     | Ring (Right)
7     | Ring (Left)
8     | Belt
9     | Boots
10    | Gloves
11    | Alternate Weapon (Right)
12    | Alternate Weapon (Left)
